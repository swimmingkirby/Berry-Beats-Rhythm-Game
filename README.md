Berry Beats is the result of a passionate collaboration among artists, developers, and music designers. This rhythm game boasts a unique pixel art style, featuring lively fruit-inspired characters dancing to funky tunes. Drawing inspiration from beloved titles like Chainsaw Dance and Friday Night Funkin', Berry Beats also allows players to create their custom beat maps.

Despite the project's discontinuation in 2021, each contributor invested their creativity and dedication, and we take immense pride in the journey. This repository serves as a dedicated archive, preserving the collective hard work devoted to Berry Beats.
